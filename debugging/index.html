                <p>CIDER ships with a powerful interactive Clojure debugger inspired by Emacs's own
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Edebug.html">Edebug</a>. You're going to love it!</p>
<p><img alt="CIDER Debugger" src="../images/cider_debugger.gif" /></p>
<h2 id="debugging">Debugging</h2>
<p>The debugger can be invoked in several ways, the simplest one is to type
<kbd>C-u C-M-x</kbd>. This will take the current top-level form, place as many
breakpoints inside it as possible (instrument it), and then evaluate it as
normal. Whenever a breakpoint is reached, you'll be shown the value and asked
for input (see below). Note that if the current form is a <code>defn</code>, it will stay
instrumented, so the debugger will be triggered every time the function is
called. To uninstrument <code>defn</code> (or similar forms), you just have to evaluate it
again as you'd normally do (e.g. with <kbd>C-M-x</kbd>).</p>
<p>Another way to trigger the debugger is by placing breakpoints yourself. Just
write <code>#break</code> before a form, and the debugger will popup every time that form is
evaluated. For instance, if you hit <kbd>C-M-x</kbd> on the following, a
breakpoint is triggered every time <code>(inspector msg)</code> is evaluated.</p>
<pre><code class="clojure">(defn eval-msg [{:keys [inspect] :as msg}]
  (if inspect
    #break (inspector msg)
    msg))
</code></pre>

<p>Instead of <code>#break</code> you can also write <code>#dbg</code> before a form, this will not only
breakpoint the form but also everything inside it. In the example above, this
places a breakpoint around <code>(inspector msg)</code> and another around <code>msg</code>. If you've
been paying attention, you may have noticed that the first option (<kbd>C-u
C-M-x</kbd>) is a quick way of evaluating the current top-level form with <code>#dbg</code>
in front.</p>
<p>At any point, you can bring up a list of all currently instrumented <code>def</code>s with
the command <kbd>M-x</kbd> <code>cider-browse-instrumented-defs</code>. Protocols and types
can be instrumented as well, but they will not be listed by this command.</p>
<h2 id="keys">Keys</h2>
<p><code>cider-debug</code> tries to be consistent with <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Edebug.html">Edebug</a>, although there are some
differences. It makes available the following bindings while stepping through
code.</p>

<p>In addition, all the usual evaluation commands (such as <kbd>C-x C-e</kbd> or
<kbd>C-c M-:</kbd>) will use the current lexical context (local variables) while
the debugger is active.</p>
<h2 id="command-details">Command Details</h2>
<p>Here are some more details about what each of the above commands does.</p>
<h3 id="stepping-commands">Stepping Commands</h3>
<p>These commands continue execution until reaching a breakpoint.</p>
<p>In the cider debugger, the term "breakpoint" refers to a place where the
debugger can halt execution and display the value of an expression. You can set
a single breakpoint with <code>#break</code>, or set breakpoints throughout a form with
<code>#dbg</code> (or by evaluating with <code>C-u C-M-x</code>). Not every form is wrapped in a
breakpoint; the debugger tries to avoid setting breakpoints on expressions that
would not be interesting to stop at, such as constants. For example, there would
not be much point in stopping execution at a literal number 23 in your code and
showing that its value is 23 - you already know that.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>next</strong>: Steps to the next breakpoint</li>
<li><strong>in</strong>: Steps in to the function about to be called. If the next breakpoint is
  not around a function call, does the same as <code>next</code>. Note that not all
  functions can be stepped in to - only normal functions stored in vars, for
  which cider can find the source. You cannot currently step in to multimethods,
  protocol functions, or functions in clojure.core (although multimethods and
  protocols can be instrumented manually).</li>
<li><strong>out</strong>: Steps to the next breakpoint that is outside of the current sexp.</li>
<li><strong>Out</strong>: Same as <code>o</code>, but skips breakpoints in other functions. That is, if
  the code being skipped over contains a call to another instrumented function,
  the debugger will stop in that function if you step out with <code>o</code>, but not if
  you step out with <code>O</code>.</li>
<li><strong>here</strong>: Place the point somewhere further on in the function being debugged,
  at the point where you want to stop next. Then press <code>h</code>, and the debugger
  will skip all breakpoints up until that spot.</li>
<li><strong>Here</strong>: Same as <code>h</code>, but skips breakpoints in other functions, as with <code>O</code>.</li>
<li><strong>continue</strong>: Continues without stopping, skipping all breakpoints.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="other-commands">Other Commands</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>eval</strong>: Prompts for a clojure expression, which can reference local
  variables that are in scope where the debugger is stopped. Displays the result
  in an overlay.</li>
<li><strong>inspect</strong>: Like eval, but displays the value in a <code>cider-inspector</code> buffer.</li>
<li><strong>locals</strong>: Opens a <code>cider-inspector</code> buffer displaying all local variables
  defined in the context where the debugger is stopped.</li>
<li><strong>inject</strong>: Replaces the currently-displayed value with the value of an
  expression that you type in. Subsequent code will see the new value that you
  entered.</li>
<li><strong>stacktrace</strong>: Shows the stacktrace of the point where the debugger is
  stopped.</li>
<li><strong>trace</strong>: Continues execution, but at each breakpoint, instead of stopping
  and displaying the value in an overlay, prints the form and its value to the
  REPL.</li>
<li><strong>quit</strong>: Quits execution immediately. Unlike with <code>continue</code>, the rest of the
  code in the debugged function is not executed.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="conditional-breakpoints">Conditional Breakpoints</h3>
<p>Breakpoints can be conditional, such that the debugger will only stop when the
condition is true.</p>
<p>Conditions are specified using <code>:break/when</code> metadata attached to a form.</p>
<pre><code class="clojure">(dotimes [i 10]
  #dbg ^{:break/when (= i 7)}
  (prn i))
</code></pre>

<p>Evaluating the above with <code>C-M-x</code>, the debugger will stop only once, when i
is 7.</p>
<p>You can also have cider insert the break-condition into your code for you. Place
the point where you want the condition to go and evaluate with <code>C-u C-u
C-M-x</code> or <code>C-u C-u C-c C-c</code>.</p>
<h2 id="internal-details">Internal Details</h2>
<p><em>This section explains a bit of the inner workings of the debugger. It is
intended mostly to help those who are interested in contributing, and doesn't
teach anything about the debugger's usage.</em></p>
<p>The CIDER debugger works in several steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>First it walks through the user's code, adding metadata to forms and symbols
   that identify their position (coordinate) in the code.</li>
<li>Then it macroexpands everything to get rid of macros.</li>
<li>
<p>Then it walks through the code again, instrumenting it. That involves a few things.</p>
<ul>
<li>It understands all existing special forms, and takes care not to instrument
  where it's not supposed to. For instance, the arglist of a <code>fn*</code> or the
  left-side of a <code>let</code>-binding.</li>
<li>Wherever it finds the previously-injected metadata (if that place is valid
  for instrumentation) it wraps the form/symbol in a macro called
  <code>breakpoint-if-interesting</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the resulting code actually gets evaluated by the Clojure compiler, the
   <code>breakpoint-if-interesting</code> macro will be expanded.  This macro decides
   whether the return value of the form/symbol in question is actually something
   the user wants to see (see below). If it is, the form/symbol gets wrapped in
   the <code>breakpoint</code> macro, otherwise it's returned as is.</p>
</li>
<li>The <code>breakpoint</code> macro takes that coordinate information that was provided in
   step <code>1.</code> and sends it over to Emacs (the front-end). It also sends the return
   value of the form and a prompt of available commands. Emacs then uses this
   information to show the value of actual code forms and prompt for the next
   action.</li>
</ol>
<p>A few example of forms that don't have interesting return values (and so are not
wrapped in a <code>breakpoint</code>):</p>
<ul>
<li>In <code>(fn [x] (inc x))</code> the return value is a function object and carries no
  information. Note that this is not the same as the return value when you
  <strong>call</strong> this function (which <strong>is</strong> interesting). Also, even those this form
  is not wrapped in a breakpoint, the forms inside it <strong>are</strong> (<code>(inc x)</code> and
  <code>x</code>).</li>
<li>Similarly, in a form like <code>(map inc (range 10))</code>, the symbol <code>inc</code> points to a
  function in <code>clojure.core</code>. That's also irrelevant (unless it's being shadowed
  by a local, but the debugger can identify that).</li>
</ul>
